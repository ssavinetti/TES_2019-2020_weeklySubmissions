	CONVECTIVE HEAT TRANSFER

As conveniently expressed by Newton’s law of cooling, the rate of convection heat transfer is observed to be proportional to the temperature difference. Newton’s law states that: 

The rate of heat loss of a body is directly proportional to the difference in the temperatures between the body and its surroundings provided the temperature difference is small and the nature of radiating surface remains same.

				Q̇ conv= (Ts-Tx)/Rconv  [W]

				Rconv=1/(h*As)

				Q̇ = h*As*ΔT
				where 
				q is the local heat flux density [W.m-2]
				h is the heat transfer coefficient [W.m-2.K]
				ΔT is the temperature difference [K]
Note that, ΔT is given by the surface or wall temperature, T wall and the bulk temperature, T∞, which is the temperature of the fluid sufficiently far from the surface.


 

Elecrtical Analogy
	Rtotal=R conv1 + Rwall + Rconv2 = 1/(h,*A) + 1/(K*A) + 1/(h,,*A) 	[°C/W)
According to this relation, it’s possible to say that the temperature drop through a surface is proportional to its thermal resistance.

	Solve the same problem as that of double pane window with the air-gap thickness of 13 mm and glass thickness of 6 mm, comment on your results and explain why we have an optimal range for the air-gap's distance. Consider a 0.8-m-high and 1.5-m-wide double-pane window consisting of two4-mm-thick layers of glass (k=0.78 W/m.°C) separated by a 10-mm-widestagnant air space (k=0.026 W/m.°C). 


	
Rconv1 = 1/(H*A)= 1/(10 W/(m^''°C)*1,2 m'') = 0,0833°C/W
Rglass 1,2= l/(K*A)= 0,006/(0,78 W/(m^''°C)*1,2 m'') = 0,0064°C/W
Rair1,2= l/(K*A)= 0,013/(0,026 W/(m^''°C)*1,2 m'') = 0,416°C/W
Rconv2 = 1/(H*A)= 1/(40 W/(m^''°C)*1,2 m'') = 0,0208°C/W
Rtotal=R conv1 + Rglass1 + Rair + Rglass2 + Rconv2= 0.5265°C/W

Determine the steady rate of heat transfer through this double-pane window and the temperature of its inner surface.
Q̇ conv= (Ts-Tx)/Rconv  = (20°C-(-10),)/(0,5265°C/W) =56,98 W


Q̇ conv= (Ts-Tx)/Rconv  = (20°C-T,)/(0,0833°C/W) ;
56,98 W = (20°C-T,)/(0,0833°C/W);
56,98 W * 0,0833 °C/ W = 20°C – T 1
T1 = ( 20 – 4.74 ) °C
T1 = 15.25 °C


Q̇ glass1 = (Ts-Tx)/Rconv  = (15.25°C-T,,)/(0,0064°C/W) ;
56,98 W = (15.25°C-T,)/(0,0064°C/W);
56,98 W * 0,0064 °C/ W = 15,25°C – T 1
T1 = (15,25 – 0,364 ) °C

56,98 W = (14,89°C-T,)/(0,416°C/W);
56,98 W * 0,416 °C/ W = 14,89°C – T 1
T1 = (14,89 – 23,70 ) °C

56,98 W = (-8,81°C-T,)/(0,0064°C/W);
56,98 W * 0,0064 °C/ W = -8,81°C – T 1
T1 = (-8,81 – 0,364 ) °C
T1 = -9.17 °C
